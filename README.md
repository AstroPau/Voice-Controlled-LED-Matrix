# Voice-Controlled-LED-Matrix

Hi! This is the first time that I publish my code so I had to make many changes and I tried to structure and explain it the best that I can. If you have any issue or you want to help, send me a message on my discord server: https://discord.gg/cFBuhKUkkX


SETTING IT UP:

1. Cloning the GitHub repository for the LED matrix in the Raspberry, you can find it at https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix where it's all explained.
2. Cloning this repository in your Raspberry.
3. Replacing the directories from the astromatrix.py file to the ones you are going to use.
4. Changing the parameters to the ones that you need for your LED Matrix.
5. Downloading the Python libraries if you haven't them installed. You can do it by typing pip3 or pip install 'library name'
6. Try to run it in your code editor (Geany, Thonny...) or run it in the terminal by going into the folder where the python file that you created is and type 'python3 filename.py'.


Here's my YouTube channel video if you want to look how it will look like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPJY3kvQkhs
